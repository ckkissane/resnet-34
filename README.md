# resnet-34

Implementation of [ResNet 34](https://arxiv.org/abs/1512.03385) in Pytorch. The notebook is roughly organized into 4 parts:
1. Implement the building blocks of the architecture (Conv2d, BatchNorm2d, ReLU, etc)
2. Implement the ResNet34 architecture using these building blocks
3. Train model on CIFAR10 training dataset
4. Classify images with the model using CIFAR10 test dataset
